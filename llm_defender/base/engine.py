    This class implements the BaseEngine that should be used by the
    specialized engines used to detect various attacks against LLM
    applications. The actual logic for the detections should be
    implemented in the engines inheriting this class.

    Attributes:
        name:
            An instance of str displaying the name of the engine
        input:
            The engine input that should be analyzed. The type is dependent on the engine.
        output:
            An instance of dict providing the output of the engine analysis
        confidence:
            An instance of float displaying the confidence score of the analysis
        cache_dir:
            The cache directory allocated for the engine.

    Methods:
        _calculate_confidence():
            Calculates the confidence. Should be invoked by the execute() function.
        _populate_data():
            Populates the engine data object. Should be invoked by the execute() function.
        get_response():
            Returns the analysis results. Should be executed for every input after the execute() function has completed.
        prepare():
            Prepares the engine. Is executed during installation.
        initialize():
            Initializes the engine. Is executed once during miner startup.
        execute():
            Executes the engine and analyzes the given input. Is executed for every input handled by the engine.
